# Tetris

My objective for this is to do an exercise by showing how you can build a game of Tetris with vanilla JavaScript. I want to demo strate the use of felx to show how you can mulipulate the pieces as they come down the screen.

As for the user it's a fun game that they can do to get a high score, there are no further levels but it will be a fun way to pass time by playing a game.
